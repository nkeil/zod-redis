  <h3>Typesafe Redis storage made easy.</h3>

## Introduction

If you're like me, you love the speed and simplicity of Redis, but miss the autocompletion and peace of mind that comes with static typing in TypeScript. With the power of [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), zredis provides a lightweight wrapper around [ioredis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis) to help you skip the headache of keeping track of your data structure, stringifying/destringifying your payload, and remembering what you're storing under which key. Specify the schema once and get/set with peace of mind.

This package is still under development! Contributions are welcome.
